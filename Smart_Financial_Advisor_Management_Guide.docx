### 1. Introduction
This guide provides instructions for managing the Smart Financial Advisor website. It covers system overview, deployment details, maintenance procedures, and troubleshooting tips.

### 2. System Overview
The Smart Financial Advisor website consists of a frontend user interface, backend logic, and a database for storing user data and financial information.

*   **Frontend**: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to interact with the financial advisor, input their financial data, and receive advice.
*   **Backend**: The backend is developed using Python and Flask. It handles user requests, processes financial data, and interacts with the database.
*   **Database**: The database is SQLite, which is a lightweight, file-based database. It stores user profiles, transaction history, and other relevant financial data.

### 3. Deployment Details

*   **Hosting Environment**: The website is hosted on a Linux server. (Specific details about the hosting provider are not relevant for this guide).
*   **Deployment Process**: The deployment process involves setting up the server environment, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring the application. (Specific commands for deployment are not included here as they are typically handled by the development team).

### 4. Maintenance and Updates

*   **Updating Content**: Content on the website can be updated by modifying the relevant HTML files or database entries. For example, to update the financial advice provided, the underlying algorithms or data sources may need to be updated.
*   **Monitoring Performance**: Server performance and application logs should be monitored regularly to ensure the website is running smoothly and to identify any potential issues. Tools like `htop` (for server monitoring) and application-specific logging can be used.
*   **Applying Security Patches**: Keeping the server and application software up-to-date with the latest security patches is crucial. This includes the operating system, web server software, Python, Flask, and any other libraries or frameworks used.

### 5. Troubleshooting

*   **Common Issues**:
    *   **Website is down**: Check server status, web server logs, and application logs to identify the cause. Restarting services or the server may be necessary.
    *   **Slow performance**: Use tools like `top` or `htop` to check server load. Optimize database queries, application code, or consider upgrading server resources if necessary.
    *   **Errors when using specific features**: Check application logs for detailed error messages. This can help pinpoint the cause of the issue, whether it's a bug in the code, a problem with the data, or an external dependency.
*   **Error Codes**:
    *   **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error**: This is a generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the server. Check the application logs for more specific information.
    *   **HTTP 404 Not Found**: This means the requested resource could not be found on the server. Check the URL for typos or incorrect paths.
*   **Contact Information**: For further assistance, contact the development team or system administrator.
