I can see the hackathon document clearly in the images. This appears to be the "AI Innovators Hackathon 2025" focused on building a Smart Financial Advisor system. Let me summarize the key information I can see:
Challenge Overview
You're tasked with building a conversational financial analysis agent that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) or database chat capabilities to analyze retail transaction data from multiple mall locations in Jordan. Your solution may leverage autonomous workflow tools (like n8n, Make or Rashed) to automate data processing and actions based on user queries.
Dataset Provided

Retail transaction records from multiple mall locations in Jordan
Format: CSV with the following fields:

transaction_id: Unique identifier with format JO-DATE-XXXX-XXXXX
mall_name: Name of the mall (Z Mall, C Mall, Y Mall, etc.)
branch_name: Specific branch location (Al Bayader, Amman, Gardens, etc.)
transaction_date: Date and time in DD/MM/YYYY HH format
tax_amount: Tax charged on the transaction
transaction_amount: Total amount of the transaction
transaction_type: Type of transaction (Sale, Refund)
transaction_status: Status of the transaction (Failed, Completed)



Objectives

Build a RAG system or database chat interface that allows users to:

Query transaction data using natural language
Ask complex analytical questions about sales performance
Request insights on transaction patterns and anomalies
Generate reports through conversation


Implement semantic retrieval that can:

Understand and interpret financial queries
Extract relevant transaction data based on user questions
Provide context-aware responses with supporting data
Handle follow-up questions with memory of previous context


Create autonomous workflows that:

Automate data processing tasks based on user queries
Set up scheduled analyses and reports
Create alert systems for transaction anomalies
Connect to other systems or services as needed



Technical Requirements

Vectorize transaction data for semantic retrieval
Implement embeddings-based search for accurate data retrieval
Build a natural language interface for database queries
Create a knowledge base from transaction patterns and insights
Develop prompt engineering templates for financial analysis
Include data citation in responses (reference specific transactions)
Set up automated workflows using tools like n8n, Make (Integromat), or similar platforms
Utilize LangChain and LangGraph for building LLM-powered applications with structured workflows

Implementation Options
RAG Approach:

Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) for transaction data
Embedding model for query and data vectorization
LLM for response generation with retrieved context
Query routing and decomposition systems
LangChain for building RAG pipelines

Database Chat Approach:

SQL generation from natural language queries
Database connector to transaction data store
Result interpretation and natural language response generation
Memory system for multi-turn conversations
LangChain SQLDatabaseChain or SQL agents

Workflow Automation

Rashed, n8n, Make (Integromat), or similar workflow automation tools
Scheduled data processing and analysis
Event-triggered workflows based on data patterns
Integration with notification systems
LangGraph for creating multi-step agent workflows with state management

Deliverables

Working conversational financial analysis application
Automated workflow configuration for data processing and actions
GitHub repository with documentation that includes a 2-3 minute demo video showing sample queries and automated workflows, and evaluation metrics on query accuracy and relevance.
