3.  **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the extracted directory, and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

No specific configuration is required beyond installing the dependencies.

### Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the `src` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```
2.  **Run the main application script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through the command line interface. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various actions such as:

*   Loading transaction data
*   Viewing transaction summaries
*   Analyzing transaction patterns
*   Detecting anomalies

### Troubleshooting

*   **Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3.11 or a compatible version. Older versions may not support all the features or libraries used in this application.
*   **Dependencies**: If you encounter errors related to missing packages, make sure you have installed all the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
*   **File Paths**: Ensure that all necessary files (e.g., data files) are in the correct locations as expected by the application. The application typically expects files to be in a `data` directory relative to the `src` directory.
